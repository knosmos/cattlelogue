*Modeling climate-driven shifts in livestock distribution using machine learning*

![](outputs/output_ada2.png)

Climate change is expected to significantly impact livestock distribution, with potential consequences for food security and ecosystem health. Current livestock distribution models are sparse due to the complexity of ecological and climatic interactions, and tend to rely on expert systems and simulations of feedback loops. Instead, we propose a machine learning approach to predict livestock distribution shifts under various climate scenarios. Our model is a proof-of-concept that uses historical livestock data and climate variables to train a neural network that can project future distributions. We hope that the speed at which such models can be built will allow for faster action on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, or to help inform areas of interest for further research.
